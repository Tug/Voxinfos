UI framework for building professional looking applications that have a consistent
experience across devices.  The J4ME looks and behaves like the mobile editions of
Google Maps, GMail, and the Opera Mini browser.

<p>The J4ME UI was built in response to shortcomings of J2ME's standard LCDUI.  It
suffers because it looks bad, behaves differently and in an unintuitive manner on almost every
phone, and is a bit cumbersome to code in because of its procedural API.

<p>The J4ME UI uses a lot of classes found in the LCDUI package.  For
example <code>javax.microedition.lcdui.Graphics</code> is still used for drawing.

<h2>Concepts</h2>

<h4>Screens</h4>

<p>The easiest way to code your application is to make a class for every screen.  There
is a small code size penalty for this because each new class takes around 200 KB.
Phones used to have many restrictions about how big the Jar file could be and you
still don't want applications to be too big since they have to be downloaded to
phones.  But these problems are not as acute as they once were and the time savings
from code simplification and clarity you gain are worth the trade off today.

<p>The base class for all screens is <code>DeviceScreen</code>.  If you screen does
free drawing over an area it would derive from this class.  The Etch-A-Sketch example
shows where this is useful.

<p><code>DeviceScreen</code> defines a title bar at the top of the screen and menu
bar at the bottom.  These are optional areas that can be hidden.  The menu bar supports
up to two options that can be selected using the phone's menu buttons (note the extra
menu buttons found on some phones are ignored, such as the middle "Menu" button on
Motorola phones).

<p><code>Dialog</code> screens are built using components.  This is the most common
type of screen and can be assembled quickly by stringing together labels, progress
bars, pictures, text boxes, and the like.  The <code>Dialog</code> class houses all
the components and lays them out on the screen.  It adds a scroll bar automatically
when the screen is not big enough to show all the components.

<p>The <code>Menu</code> classes are the last common type of screens.  These are
just menus where the user can select from multiple options.

<h4>Components</h4>

<p>Components are just UI widgets that can be placed onto a screen.  Common examples are
labels and text boxes.  Typically components are used with the <code>DeviceScreen</code>
class, but that is not a requirement.  Components are discussed in more detail in the
<code>org.j4me.examples.ui.components</code> package.

<h4>Themes</h4>

<p>The appearance of applications can be completely adjusted by supplying a different
<code>Theme</code> class.  The most common change is to use a different color scheme.
However, more complex changes can be made such as displaying background images.

<h2>Porting</h2>

<p>The J4ME UI API is designed to be similar to the LCDUI.  However, each J4ME screen
is typically defined by its own class with methods that can be overridden to handle
menu commands.  Therefore set aside some time for porting; perhaps 15 minutes per
screen.

<p>Start your porting with the following steps.  There will certainly be compile errors
due to scope errors that need be cleaned up when you are done.  But this should get
you most of the way and illustrate the differences between the J4ME and LCDUI APIs.
<ul>
 <li>In your MIDlet's <code>startApp</code> method add <code>UIManager.init(this);</code> as the first line
 <li>Change occurrences of the <code>Canvas</code> class to <code>DeviceScreen</code>
 <li>Change occurrences of the <code>Form</code> class to <code>Dialog</code>
 <li>Replace <code>CommandListener.commandAction</code> methods with overrides of <code>declineNotify</code> and <code>acceptNotify</code>
 <li>Each <code>Item</code> is replaced by its <code>Component</code> counterpart; for example <code>Guage</code> with <code>ProgressBar</code>
</ul>

<h2>Example</h2>

<p>Examples are provided in the <code>/examples</code> folder under the
<code>org.j4me.examples.ui.*</code> packages.  The examples all run under the
<code>UIDemoMidlet</code>:
<ul>
 <li><i>Components</i> shows each of the different components in action on a <code>Dialog</code> screen
 <li><i>Themes</i> lets you select from several different themes to see how they change the appearance of an application
 <li><i>Key Code</i> gives the integer value of each key on your phone
 <li><i>Etch A Sketch</i> demonstrates using the <code>DeviceScreen</code> class directly
 <li><i>Stopwatch</i> is the most basic example of how to use the J4ME UI
</ul>
