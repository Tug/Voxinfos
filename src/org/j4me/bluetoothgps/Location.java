/**
 * The <code>Location</code> class represents the standard set of basic location
 * information. This includes the timestamped coordinates, accuracy, speed,
 * course, and information about the positioning method used for the location,
 * plus an optional textual address.
 * <p>
 * The location method is indicated using a bit field. The individual bits are
 * defined using constants in this class. This bit field is a bitwise
 * combination of the location method technology bits (MTE_*), method type
 * (MTY_*) and method assistance information (MTA_*). All other bits in the 32
 * bit integer than those that have defined constants in this class are reserved
 * and MUST not be set by implementations (i.e. these bits must be 0).
 * <p>
 * A <code>Location</code> object may be either 'valid' or 'invalid'. The validity
 * can be queried using the <code>isValid</code> method. A valid <code>Location</code>
 * object represents a location with valid coordinates and the
 * <code>getQualifiedCoordinates</code> method must return their coordinates. An
 * invalid <code>Location</code> object doesn't have valid coordinates, but the extra
 * info that is obtained from the <code>getExtraInfo</code> method can provide
 * information about the reason why it was not possible to provide a valid
 * <code>Location</code>. For an invalid <code>Location</code> object, the
 * <code>getQualifiedCoordinates</code> method may return either <code>null</code> or some
 * coordinates where the information is not necessarily fully correct. The
 * periodic location updates to the <code>LocationListener</code> may return invalid
 * <code>Location</code> objects if it isn't possible to determine the location.
 * <p>
 * This class is only a container for the information. When the platform
 * implementation returns <code>Location</code> objects, it MUST ensure that it only
 * returns objects where the parameters have values set as described for their
 * semantics in this class.
